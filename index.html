        We are delighted to invite you to our wedding in the Philippines on the
        beautiful island of Bohol. We recently had a holiday on a beach in the
        Philippines and we thought it would be the perfect place to get married
        - surrounded by palm trees, white sands, turquoise waters and our loving
        friends and family, there to celebrate with us.

        Ensuring your safety and comfort is our utmost priority. Unlike busier
        parts of the Philippines, the island of Bohol is tranquil and uncrowded.
        There are 142 resorts on the island and it is a popular holiday
        destination with people from all around the world.
      </p>
      <p>
        The island is accessible by both plane and boat, which will make it
        convenient for you to get there. For detailed information on how to get
        there please <a href="#how-to-get-there">click here</a>.

      <p>
        Bohol is located in the central Visayas region of the Philippines and is
        renowned for its breathtaking natural beauty. It enjoys a mild climate
        with daytime temperatures in May around 33째C (91째F) and pleasant nights
        at 24째C (75째F). We've chosen May to avoid the rainy season, which comes
        later in the year. This will be perfect for our ceremony and reception
        on the beach.
