        We are delighted to invite you to our wedding in the Philippines on the
        beautiful island of Bohol. We recently had a holiday on a beach in the
        Philippines and we thought it would be the perfect place to get married
        - surrounded by palm trees, white sands, turquoise waters and our loving
        friends and family, there to celebrate with us.

        Ensuring your safety and comfort is our highest priority. Unlike busier
        parts of the Philippines, the island of Bohol is tranquil and uncrowded.
        There are 142 resorts spaced out across the island and it is a popular
        holiday destination with people from all around the world, although most
        tourists to the Philippines go to more famous destinations like Boracay,
        Palawan or Siargao. Bohol is a safe tourist destination and has a
        small-town, quiet vibe.
      </p>
      <p>
        Aside from its natural beauty and safety, another reason we chose Bohol
        as our wedding destination is that it is very easy to get there. Bohol
        is located in the central Visayas region of the Philippines and is
        accessible by both plane and boat. There is an airport on the island.

        May is summer time in the Philippines. Daytime temperatures in May are
        around 33째C (91째F) and at night it is a pleasant 24째C (75째F). We've
        chosen May to avoid the rainy season, which comes later in the year.
        This will be perfect for our ceremony and reception on the beach.

      <h1>Things to do in Bohol</h1>
      <p>
        Bohol is a tropical paradise with a lot of activities on offer. Here are
        some of the things you can do while you are in Bohol: How far away and
        how to get to each from Oceanica.

        <p>
          Visit the Chocolate Hills - the most famous attraction in Bohol. The
          Chocolate Hills are a geological formation of over 1200 hills over an
          area of more than 50 square kilometers. The hills are covered in green
          grass that turns brown during the dry season, hence the name. The trip
          is a 1.5 hour drive from Oceanica resort. Be ready to

        <p>
          The Tarsier Sanctuary. The Philippine tarsier is the smallest and
          cutest primate in the world. These tiny creatures have large eyes and
          are very sensitive to light. They are nocturnal and primarily found in
          the forests of Bohol. There are 2 sanctuaries you can visit - the
          Tarsier and Wildlife Sanctuary in Corella which is 50 minutes drive
          from Oceanica resort and the Tarsier Conservation Area near Loboc
          which is 1.5 hours drive from Oceanica.
          <a href="https://whatmegdidnext.com/tarsiers-in-bohol/">This blog</a>

          A cruise on the Loboc River. The Loboc river is famous for its
          beautiful cruises. Guests can enjoy a buffet meal on a floating
          restaurant while being serenaded by local musicians. The cruise passes
          through lush greenery and stops off at a folk-dance where you can
          participate if you want to. Overall its a very happy way to spend a
          few hours around lunch. The river is 1 hour drive from Oceanica and
          the cruise costs less than $30 per person.

        Oceanica Resort is on the southern tip of Bohol. Technically it is on
        the island of Panglao. However Panglao is connected to the main island
        of Bohol by a bridge, so driving there is easy if coming by boat.

      <p>Hot tip: Avoid flying with Cebu Pacific. They are always late.</p>
      <p>
        Hot tip: For international guests we recommend that you fly from Manila
        to Bohol, rather than Cebu. This way you can avoid transferring from the
        Airport in Cebu to the Seaport in Cebu.
      </p>
      <h1>Manila to Bohol by plane</h1>
      <p>
        If you arrive in the Philippines by plane then travel from Ninoy Aquino
        International Airport in Manila to Panglao International Airport in
        Bohol takes 1.5 hours by plane.
      </p>
      <h1>Cebu to Bohol by plane</h1>
      <p>
        Cebu is the neighbouring island to Bohol so it is not really worth
        flying. In fact all the flights we could see appear to go via Manila,
        which is at least a 3 hour round trip!
      </p>
      <h1>Cebu to Bohol by boat</h1>
      <p>
        If you are not bringing your car on the boat to Bohol then the Oceanjet
        Fastcraft is the fastest option. The trip takes 2 hours and costs less
        than $30.

        >
      </p>
      <p>
        If you need to bring your car then the Lite Shipping Ferry (roll-on,
        roll-off) is the best option.

      <h1>Bohol Airport to Oceanica Resort</h1>
      <p>
        Bohol Panglao International Airport is only 5km or 10 minutes drive from
        Oceanica Resort. An airport transfer must be booked via the Oceanica
        Resort in advance. The following rates are available for exclusive
